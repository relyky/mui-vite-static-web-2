# Project Overview

This is a static web application built with Vite, React, TypeScript, and Material-UI. It serves as a basic starter template for creating a static website that can be deployed to services like Azure Static Web Apps.

## Key Technologies

*   **Vite:** A fast build tool and development server.
*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript.
*   **Material-UI:** A popular React UI framework.

# Building and Running

## Development

To run the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server and open the application in your browser.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the optimized and minified production build.

## Previewing the Production Build

To preview the production build locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run preview
```

# Development Conventions

*   The project uses TypeScript for type safety.
*   Components are organized in the `src` directory.
*   The main application entry point is `src/main.tsx`.
*   The root application component is `src/App.tsx`.
*   Styling is done using Material-UI's styling solutions.
